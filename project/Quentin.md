# Abstract
-- A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? 
-- What's the motivation behind your project?
Web-based marketplaces turned gigantic. As a result, a customer looking for a specific item 
will get hundreds of results, ranging from comparable to identic items. Our goal is to find out 
more about these duplicate items : among similar items, which version is bought the most frequently ?
Are theres significant differences between these similar items ? As a customer, which version 
of the duplicates is your best pick ?
Our work will be based on the amazon products and reviews dataset, and we will seek to answer these questions.	 


# Research questions
-- A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 


# Dataset
We'll use the amazon products and reviews dataset. We may decide to limit ourselves to subcategories of it, either 
the "5-cores", to avoid having a dataset that's too sparse, or quite possible some subcategories ("health", "books",
"office products", "Cell phones and accessories"...) if we conclude these subsets are more interesting (in that it's 
easier to find caracteristics to compare, or they are more populated...)
The vast variety of subsets makes this dataset's size easier to handle, in that we have options to treat a lower
volume of data if necessary.
A JSON parser will be required.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Parse the dataset into python to be able to take a better look at it.
filter the features we wish to keep from those we think are not useful
Find way to classify review from the customers (detect positive / negative keywords, ... ?)
