# Abstract
-- A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? 
-- What's the motivation behind your project?
Web-based marketplaces turned gigantic. As a result, a customer looking for a specific item 
will get hundreds of results, ranging from comparable to identic items. Our goal is to find out 
more about these duplicate items : among similar items, which version is bought the most frequently ?
Are theres significant differences between these similar items ? As a customer, which version 
of the duplicates is your best pick ?
Our work will be based on the amazon products and reviews dataset, and we will seek to answer these questions.
