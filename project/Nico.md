# Title
Amazon, the quest of the same products

# Abstract
Ever looked at a specific product on Amazon? There is a ton of offers for the exact same item! Why did you choose to buy specially this one?
We want to know why an item is more popular than the other bids.
Every sales are differents, some are more expensive, some are less. Some have better review, some are not available in your country.

# Research questions
On Amazon, why an item is more popular and is sold more than its duplicate?
What are the parameters that define that an item is better than its equivalent?

# Dataset
We want to use the Amazon dataset, provided in the course; both the review and the metadata dataset. (So at most 20 + 3.1 gb in Json)
We need to group all the Amazon items by duplicates and decide which are useful for our project. 
The popularity of sale of an item will be computed thanks to the parameter salesRank. the hard part will be to consider an item as a duplicate, for that we will use the title, price, also_viewed, also_bought, categories and brand as useful informations.
And then, we will answer our questions with the dataset of the amazon review and the metadata previously cited.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
-Define the useful feature
-Clean the data
-Select the categories of product we want to analyse (Amazon has 24 categories of item)
-Think about how to presents the project in term of data visualisation
-Have our first results

# Questions for TAa
Is this project realisable and in the theme “data science for social good”?
Isn't it strange to have homeworks and project at the same time regarding the amount of work?
